## Shopper Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)

### About this project:

The objective of this project is to segment shoppers from a dataset given. Three different unsupervised machine learning algorithms were used for this project. At the end of the notebook, you can find the evaluation of those models comparing metrics as ARS (Adjusted Rand Score), NMI (Normalized Mutual Information) and Average Score.
