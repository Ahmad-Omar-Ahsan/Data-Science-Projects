# Data Science Projects

Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning. Those are presented
through Jupyter Notebooks and datasets (csv files).


## Content:

- ### Machine Learning

  - [Shopper Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning):](https://github.com/mwpnava/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/ShopperSegments_prediction) The objective of this project is to segment shoppers from a dataset given. K-Means, Agglomerative and DBSCAN are the three different unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for the project. At the end of the notebook, you can find the evaluation of those models comparing metrics as ARS (Adjusted Rand Score), NMI (Normalized Mutual Information) and Average Score.

  - [Online News Popularity Prediction (Supervised Learning):](https://github.com/mwpnava/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Popularity_prediction) This is a Supervised Learning Project which objective is to predict the popularity of articles published by Mashable website. The machine learning algorithms used for this project were: Random Forest, Support Vector Classification and KNN / K-Nearest Neighbor.

  - [Predictions of Admissions to Master's Degree (Supervised Learning):](https://github.com/mwpnava/thinkful/blob/master/Linear_regression.ipynb) Using a Linear Regression Algorithm, this project was developed to predict the chance of admission of foreign students to Master's Degree Programs in American Colleges.

*Tools: SciKit Learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib adn seaborn*


- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

  - [Women Legal Rights in the World:](https://github.com/mwpnava/thinkful/blob/master/Capstone_1:Analytic_Report_and_Research_Proposal.ipynb) This is an Analytic Report of legal gender differentiation around the world. The analysis of data collected in 187 countries, from 2009 to 2018, highlights the inequity in terms of laws and regulations.

*Tools: Seaborn, pandas, and matplotlib*
